# TidyData
Course work from data science at coursera - Getting and cleaning data

Processing the ‘Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset’

The following steps were performed on the dataset:

1. The run_analysis.R file is a script that reads in the x, y, subject test and train data and merges it together.

2. It then adds appropriate column names and activity names to the dataset

3. A selection of the required fields (i.e. with mean and standard deviation) is then made

4. The column names are cleaned up and made more descriptive

5. The data is then grouped by subject and activity and the average is found per variable.

6. The resultant tidy data is written out to a text file.

Please see the Codebook for more information on the raw data, its experimental design and the processed data.
